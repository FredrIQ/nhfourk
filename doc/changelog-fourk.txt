NetHack Fourk Changelog
=======================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

These changes are in chronological order, most recent at top.

 * Any given type of monster becomes less likely to drop corpses and
   death drops as you kill more and more of them.  Somewhere around
   150 kills, you altogether stop getting corpses for that kind of
   monster.  This is expected to be most noticeable with puddings but
   may also be relevant for extinctionists and throne farmers.  I'd
   have made it top out at a thousand or so kills, but the kill count
   only goes up to 255, probably so it can fit in a single byte.  In
   any case, this is unlikely to be noticed in normal play except with
   large creatures such as dragons, which are no longer guaranteed to
   drop corpses every single time.

 * To compensate for the reduced death drops as you kill many monsters
   of the same kind (which happens in normal play for some monsters,
   particularly common ones generated in groups), the base death drop
   probability has been adjusted upward.  Thus, the first few monsters
   you kill of any given type are now more likely to leave death drops
   than before.  This needs play testing for balance, but the
   intention is that the overall number of death drops in a typical
   normal (non-farming) game should be about the same.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.

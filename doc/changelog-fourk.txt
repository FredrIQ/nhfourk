NetHack Fourk Changelog
=======================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

These changes are in chronological order, most recent at top.

 * Any given type of monster becomes less likely to drop corpses as
   you kill more and more of them.  Somewhere around 150 kills, you
   altogether stop getting corpses for that kind of monster.  This
   is expected to be most noticeable with puddings but may also be
   relevant for extinctionists and throne farmers.  I'd have made
   it top out at a thousand or so kills, but the kill count only 
   goes up to 255, probably so it can fit in a single byte.  In any
   case, this is unlikely to be noticed in normal play except with
   large creatures such as dragons, which are no longer guaranteed
   to drop corpses every single time.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.

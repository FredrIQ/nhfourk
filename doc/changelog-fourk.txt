NetHack Fourk Changelog
=======================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

These changes are in chronological order, most recent at top.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.

NetHack Fourk Changelog Overview:
=================================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

Thematically, the major changes fall into the following overall
categories:

 * Balance adjustments.  Various formulae have been revised, to
   improve the overall balance and difficulty curve of the game.
   Things like death-drop probability, engraving success rate,
   alignment record, etc. have had the shape of their curve adjusted,
   and some game features have been buffed or gently nerfed so that
   they fit better into the overall scheme of the game's balance.
   
 * Monster/class reorganization.  Some classes with very few monsters
   have been combined and thus freed up, so that in a subsequent
   version some heavily overloaded monster classes can be split,
   without running out of letters.  I tried to be conservative about
   this, and for now I tried to avoid having any monster look exactly
   the same as another monster used to look, when it can be avoided.
   
 * Monster differentiation.  Some monsters that were for practical
   purposes identical in their gameplay significance have been
   tweaked slightly so that they are no longer exactly the same.


Chronological Changelog (most recent at top):
=============================================

 * Barring bones, the only variant of Minetown that might not have a
   general store now is College Town, which has a guaranteed book
   shop, so you can at least easily price check scrolls (and books).

 * The Mimic of the Mines level has been made more interesting,
   bringing it somewhat closer to the other Mine's End levels in terms
   of both difficulty and loot.

 * Certain normally rare items are supplied in small numbers early in
   the game as floor items.  Specifically, filler levels at depth 2-6
   in the main dungeon each have an 80% chance to get one of these
   items, which is most often a scroll of scare monster but can also
   be wolfsbane, eucalytus, or a wand of enlightenment.

 * Pulled in about fifty fixes for various vanilla bugs from an
   upstream "4.3 maintenance" branch.  The upstream master hasn't
   merged these changes yet for reasons involving release timing,
   but Fourk is at a different place in its dev cycle that makes
   them appropriate now.

 * The ever controversial Acehack/NetHack4 floating eye behavior
   (wherein you can't melee them at all) has been replaced with a new
   behavior that will probably be equally controversial but hopefully
   more interesting:  whatever hp damage you do to the floating eye
   you also sustain yourself, amplified proprortionally to your own
   experience level.  The exact formula may may to be tweaked, pending
   play testing.  The formula for monster-vs-monster is different
   from the formula for player-vs-monster, not because I think it
   should be, but because rebalancing player hitpoints vs monster
   hitpoints is a larger change that I didn't want to rush into yet.

 * Insteadeath by poison when you could have survived the damage
   will now only drain a level rather than killing you outright,
   if you are at least XL3.  Furthermore, starting characters have
   a 500-turn grace period to reach XL3 to protect against this.
   (You can still die by falling onto poisoned spikes or being hit by
   a poisoned weapon or whatever, if you do not have enough current HP
   to survive the damage that it does, or if you are running around
   at XL1 or XL2 past turn 500.)

 * The supply of rocks has been increased, because slings are bad
   enough, compared to other launchers, without having to constantly
   worry about running out of rocks (which aren't even supposed to
   be the primary ammo; they're what you use when you're trying to
   conserve or have run out of flint and glass).

 * The Wizard of Yendor now has an attack that can change your
   alignment (law/neu/cha), but this effect is blocked if you are
   pious.  The main upshot of this is that early (pre-quest) alignment
   conversion no longer makes the game unwinnable, although it is
   still a significant inconvenience, since you will need to fight the
   Wizard before doing the quest, which is not the usual strategy.

 * The shopkeeper names list for general stores has been expanded,
   since that is the most common type of shop.  Also, some tool shop
   owners have been re-inserted into the list that were in (at least
   some ports of) 3.4.3 but had been removed at some point due to the
   #ifdef purge and/or platforms being dropped.  (This re-insert was
   not comprehensive.)

 * Arrows (against small monsters) and darts have been slightly
   buffed: one additional point of base damage.

 * Cherry-picked two trap-related changes from the Gehennom Fun Patch.
   Falling rock traps are no longer generated on levels 1-3 in the
   main dungeon, and when a monster is changed by a polymorph trap,
   there is now a chance for the trap to be used up.  The probability
   of this drops off deeper into the dungeon.  To be able to use the
   same polymorph trap on pets indefinitely with no chance of it being
   used up, you must find one at dungeon level 35 or deeper.

 * Made rock piercers brown, lurkers above red.  Eventually
   these will all be in mlet t (S_TRAPPER).

 * Marked umber hulks as HI_ULINE (i.e., underlined).  This
   is a pre-emptive measure, done for the same reason that xorns
   are now red:  eventually both of these large, distinctive,
   deep-rock-dwelling creatures are going to be in the same
   monster class together, probably mlet X (S_XORN), and I don't
   want either of them looking exactly the same as the other
   one used to look, if it can be avoided.

 * Moved leprechauns into the S_IMP (lowercase i) mlet class.
   For detailed justification, see the changelog entry (834cebee),
   but in brief, they are mischevious but usually not outright
   dangerous spirit/faerie beings appearing with a physical body,
   playing pranks, meddling, occasionally making people's fortunes,
   and there is folklore associated with capturing them, all of
   which is also true of imps and tengu.  Additionally, they are
   diminutive in stature like imps and quasits.  This reduces the
   number of in-use map characters by one, which is a Good Thing.
   To distinguish, leprechauns are bright green and homonculi are
   now gray (previously, both were green).

 * Differentiated nymphs.  Wood nymphs are the lowest-level and
   slightly easier to deal with than before (notably, they are now
   slightly slower than the player); water nymphs are a little
   tougher, and mountain nymphs are now the highest-level and most
   difficult nymphs.  They do NOT grow up into each other.  However,
   water nymphs (barring fountain schenanighans, which are always a
   player's fault) and especially mountain nymphs should now start
   showing up a little later in the game than before; wood nymphs
   should start showing up around the same time as before.

 * Changed the colors of two monsters (xorns to red, acid blobs to
   yellow, matching yellow dragons).  This is a pre-emptive measure
   to reduce color conflicts later, when certain monster classes
   eventually get combined.  Might as well let users go ahead and
   get used to the new colors for these monsters now.

 * Unicorn horns are now a technically finite resource (unless you can
   cast cancellation).  What happens is, applying a non-cursed unicorn
   horn when you have a problem it can fix has a 33% chance of
   reducing its enchantment by one point, unless it is already at or
   below -3, in which case it is simply destroyed without providing
   any benefit.  Cursed unicorn horns and the "Nothing happens" case
   are unchanged.

 * The formula for the player's odds of hitting monsters has been
   adjusted significantly.  Luck and experience level are now only
   added in on a logarithmic scale (together), meaning that always
   hitting everything no matter what is (hopefully) no longer a
   foregone conclusion in the late game.  It is to be expected that
   further tweaks to this formula will be required.

 * Disabled the "network MOTD" feature, since it requires a public
   server, which Fourk currently does not have.

 * Alignment record points are no longer granted for killing most
   kinds of monsters.

 * Gaining alignment record points through sacrifice is now somewhat
   more difficult (especially for non-chaotics); although certain
   kinds of special-cased corpses are still particularly effective.

 * Alignment record now starts at 10 for lawfuls, 15 for neutrals,
   20 for chaotics.  (These numbers may get adjusted later, not sure;
   as it stands, it means chaotics don't have to improve their record
   at all to go on the quest; lawfuls must improve it by 10.)  For
   now, the role-specific differences in starting alignment have been
   evened out; this may change later, as part of role differentiation,
   but I want to get the basic balance figured out first.

 * The chance for an engraving to be successfully written exactly as
   intended, rather than in a pre-eroded form, now starts higher than
   in 3.4.3 but falls off if you write Elbereth too many times.  The
   number of times you can write Elbereth and still keep a good chance
   of writing things successfully is proportional to experience level
   and is also somewhat better for forms of engraving that use up
   resources.  Players who use Elbereth sparingly in emergencies are
   likely to notice a positive effect on its reliability (if they know
   enough not to smudge it after writing it, write one at a time,
   etc.); players who abuse Elbereth extensively will definitely
   notice that it is less reliable now.  Failure is accompanied by
   messages about your body_part(HAND) cramping up.

 * To compensate for the reduced death drops as you kill many monsters
   of the same kind (which happens in normal play for some monsters,
   particularly common ones generated in groups), the base death drop
   probability has been adjusted upward.  Thus, the first few monsters
   you kill of any given type are now more likely to leave death drops
   than before.  This needs play testing for balance, but the
   intention is that the overall number of death drops in a typical
   normal (non-farming) game should be about the same.

 * Any given type of monster becomes less likely to drop corpses and
   death drops as you kill more and more of them.  Somewhere around
   150 kills, you altogether stop getting corpses for that kind of
   monster.  This is expected to be most noticeable with puddings but
   may also be relevant for extinctionists and throne farmers.  I'd
   have made it top out at a thousand or so kills, but the kill count
   only goes up to 255, probably so it can fit in a single byte.  In
   any case, this is unlikely to be noticed in normal play except with
   large creatures such as dragons, which are no longer guaranteed to
   drop corpses every single time.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.

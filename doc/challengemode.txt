A player asked for a list of differences in challenge mode.  I hadn't
been maintaining one until now, but here we go:
 * Effective minimum monster difficulty is 1 higher than in normal mode,
   and maximium is 1.25 times as high.
 * Elemental resistances reduce damage to 1/3, rather than to 0.
 * HP regeneration is slower (for the player).
 * Sleep attacks put you to sleep for longer.
 * The chances of AD_DRST, AD_DRDX, and AD_DRCO attacks 
   draining the corresponding attribute are higher.
 * The chance of a c attack starting the stoning process is higher.
 * The chance of an eel wrapping itself around you (to 
   drown you) is higher.
 * Amulet stealing attacks are four times as likely to succeed.
 * Nurse dancing is less effective.
 * Gremlins are more likely to steal properties.
 * Stunning and slowing attacks are twice as likely to affect you.
 * Confusion and drain-energy attacks always succeed against you
   (if MC doesn't block them).
 * Death's touch works slightly differently.  (NOTE TO SELF:  maybe not as intended.)
 * Regaining lost levels (via potion of full healing or via prayer)
   works as in vanilla:  you can only ever regain half of them
   (rounded up).  In normal mode, you can regain all of them.
 * There's a score multiplier.
 * Killing anything disqualifies you from entering the quest at
   experience level 1, even if you don't gain a level from it.
 * Scrolls of identify will identify fewer objects on average.
 * A blessed scroll of charging will sometimes work as uncursed.
 * The minimum luck needed to be guaranteed a wish is higher.
 * Charged rings in starting inventory are more likely to be +1
